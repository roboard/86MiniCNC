# 86MiniCNC

86MiniCNC is an open-source, all 3D-printed Mini CNC designed by Chris Wang (chris.wang@dmp.com.tw) for Motion86 library DEMO (http://www.86duino.com/?p=19443&lang=TW).
All parts as well as the actuator mechanism are printed by "86Duino Enjoy" 3D Printer. 
All STL are available and welcome to download.

The controller of 86MiniCNC is "86Duino One" which is a powerful MCU or say mini-computer. 
It's arduino-compatible and can absolutely do much more than what arduino can do.
